# Export Customizing Transports



All Business Configuration changes are recorded in a different request, depending on the Customizing Objects.

-   Client-specific Business Configurations are recorded in a request of type “Customizing Request”

-   Cross-client Business Configurations are recorded in a request of type “Cross-Client Customizing Request”

Unlike ABAP Repository Objects, Customizing Objects recorded in a request are not locked against access by other Business Users.

With this app, you can manage these requests.
